# FACEBOOK INC. AND THE EU-U.S. and SWISS-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD

Facebook Inc. (“Facebook”) has certified to the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework">EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework</a> (collectively, “Privacy Shield Frameworks”) with the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection and processing of personal data from our advertisers, customers, or business partners in the European Union and, where a Swiss data controller uses Facebook as a data processor, Switzerland (“Partners”) in connection with the products and services described in the Scope section below and in our <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC">certification</a>. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program please visit <a href= "https://www.privacyshield.gov/">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.

## Scope:

Facebook adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (as set out in each of the Privacy Shield Frameworks) for the following areas of our business (collectively the “Partner Services”):

- **Workplace Premium**: Workplace Premium is a service that allows people to more effectively collaborate and share information at work. Partners (employers or organizations - the data controllers) may submit personal information about their members to Facebook, with Facebook Ireland as the processor and Facebook Inc. as a sub-processor. While Partners and their members decide what information to submit, it typically includes things like business contacts, customer and employee information, employee-generated content and communications, and other information under the Partner’s control. For more information, members may contact the Partner through which they hold a Workplace account and review Workplace’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/FB_Work_Privacy">privacy policy</a>.

- **Ads and Measurement**: Facebook offers Ads and Measurement products and through those services Facebook may receive personal data from unaffiliated Partners (the data controllers) where Facebook Ireland is the processor and Facebook Inc. is a sub-processor. This includes things like contact information and information about individuals’ experiences or interactions with the Partners and their products, services, and ads. For more information about our ads and measurement products, visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/about">About Advertising on Facebook</a> page and our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">Data Policy</a>.

Facebook uses the personal data provided by our Partners to provide Partner Services in accordance with the terms applicable to the relevant Partner Service and otherwise with the Partners’ instructions. Facebook works with its Partners to ensure that individuals are offered appropriate choices applicable under the Privacy Shield Principles.

## Access.

Within the scope of our authorization to do so, and in accordance with our commitments under the Privacy Shield, Facebook will work with its Partners to provide individuals access to personal data about them that Facebook holds on behalf of its Partners. Facebook also will take reasonable steps to enable individuals, either directly or in connection with the Partners, to correct, amend, or delete personal data that is demonstrated to be inaccurate.

## Third Parties.

Facebook may transfer data within the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678">Facebook family of companies</a> and to third parties, including service providers and other partners. In accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Facebook is liable for any processing of personal data by such third parties that is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles unless Facebook was not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage.

## Legal Requests.

Personal data that is transferred to us by our Partners may be subject to disclosure pursuant to legal requests or other judicial and government process, such as subpoenas, warrants, or orders. For more information, review the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">“How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?”</a> section of the Facebook Data Policy and the “Legal Requests” section of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/FB_Work_Privacy">Workplace Privacy Policy</a>.

## Enforcement.

Facebook’s compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

Additionally, as part of the Privacy Shield Frameworks, the U.S. State Department Senior Coordinator serves as the Ombudsperson to facilitate the processing of requests relating to national security access to data transmitted from the EU and Switzerland (respectively) to the U.S.
